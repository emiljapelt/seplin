1. Look at syntax error handling, https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec69
4. Setup some automated testing
7. Fix assembly compiler
8. Implement escape characters in string literals
9. Develope syntax highlighting for vscode, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/tree/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes
10. Implement routine signature compatability check
11. Implement routine name overloading
12. Fix machine/compiler interaction 
    - currently failes if the source file is not in 'cwd'
13. Replace routine declaration with variable declarations of anonymous routines
    - likely required changing how the binaries are handled by machine
        - Specifically the TO_START instruction
    - 'internal', 'external' and 'entry' will need to apply to variables
    - the environment structure needs to change, i.e. no longer contain routines seperatly
    - variables from other contexts need to become available to the local context
        - 'internal's should still be inaccesible
14. Fix variable modifiers, broken for const array index assignments
