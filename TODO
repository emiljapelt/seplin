- structs and arrays
  - Create a wrapper for malloc that keeps track of the min/max allocated address
      - in use: 8[header]x[payload]
      - LSB of header is 1 for data structures (structs/arrays).
      - The LSB 4 bytes (except LSB) is the number of fields, as an unsigned int (size of the allocation in 8 bytes).
      - The MSB 4 bytes is the number of heap objects referencing the object, as an unsiged int.
    - When doing a freeing pass over parameters, each parameters reference count is decremented, and any if it becomes 0, the object is freed.
      - When freeing a structure, each of it non-null fields gets it reference counter decremented, and if it becomes 0 that fields refereced object gets freed recursivly.
  - All references are direct heap refereces, i.e. follow_path will not be needed.
  - Do not handle types in the VM, just the sizes BYTE, SHORT, HALF, INT and a CUSTOM for varibale sizes
    - Handle correct typing and checks in the compiler
    - Generic DECLARE instructions
    - Generic ASSIGN instructions
    - Generic FETCH instructions
    - FETCH and ASSIGN instructions needs an alternative working at an offset, but not outside an allocation, to access struct/array fields. Check this using the size header.
      - FETCH_FULL(addr)
      - OFFSET_FETCH(addr, offset)
      - ASSIGN_FULL(addr, val)
      - OFFSET_ASSIGN(addr, offset, val)
  - Arrays are just STRUCT allocations.
    - DECLARE_STRUCT(size)
  - Structs are also just STRUCT allocations.
    - DECLARE_STRUCT(field_count)
  - Idea for structs:
    - Definition:
      struct adult {
        int age := 18;
        bool dead := false;
        adult nemisis;
      }
    - Construction:
      var emil = new person;                                 ~= PLACE_INT(3), DECLARE_STRUCT, CLONE_FULL, DECLARE_FULL, CLONE_FULL, PLACE_INT(18), ASSIGN_FULL, PLACE_INT(0), OFFSET_ASSIGN, CLONE_FULL, DECLARE_BYTE, CLONE_BYTE, PLACE_BOOL(false), ASSIGN_BYTE, PLACE_INT(1), OFFSET_ASSIGN
    - Access:
      var emilAgeIn5 := emil[age] + 5                        ~= #FETCH emil#, PLACE_INT(0), OFFSET_FETCH
      var emilNemisisAgeIn5 := emil[nemisis][age] + 5        ~= #FETCH emil#, PLACE_INT(1), OFFSET_FETCH, PLACE_INT(1), OFFSET_FETCH
  - Idea for arrays:
    - Construction:
      var numbers := new int[5];                             ~= PLACE_INT(5), DECLARE_STRUCT
    - Assign:
      numbers[2] := 3;                                       ~= #FETCH numbers#, PLACE_INT(2), OFFSET_FETCH, PLACE_INT(3), ASSIGN_FULL
    - Access:
      var third := numbers[2];                               ~= #FETCH numbers#, PLACE_INT(2), OFFSET_FETCH, FETCH_FULL
